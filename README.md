# epiCalendar

The fork of a Python script that converts your personal SIES calendar to a csv format. Works best with EPI calendars.

## Webpage

You can use the (beta) [web version](https://epicalendar.herokuapp.com/) to convert your calendar on the fly!

## Requirements

- python3
- [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)

Web requirements:
- [flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/)
- [gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/)

## Usage

- Download [the script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miermontoto/epiCalendar/main/epiCalendar.py). (← right click, save link as)
- Run the script using python and input your `JSESSIONID` cookie.

```
> python3 epiCalendar.py
Enter JSESSIONID: 0000XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX:1dXXXXXXX
```

You can also run the script with the cookie as a parameter:
```sh
python3 epiCalendar.py 0000XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX:1dXXXXXXX
```

### Obtaining JSESSIONID

To obtain your personal and expiring `JSESSIONID`, login into SIES and press F12 (or Ctrl+Shift+I) and navigate to the "Storage" section. You should find at least two cookies. Copy the `JSESSIONID` from `/serviciosacademicos` and paste it into the script's input.

- `[-h | --help]` to show the help dialog.
