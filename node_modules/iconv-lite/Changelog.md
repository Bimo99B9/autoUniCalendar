## 0.6.3 / 2021-05-23
  * Fix HKSCS encoding to prefer Big5 codes if both Big5 and HKSCS codes are possible (#264)


## 0.6.2 / 2020-07-08
  * Support Uint8Array-s decoding without conversion to Buffers, plus fix an edge case.


## 0.6.1 / 2020-06-28
  * Support Uint8Array-s directly when decoding (#246, by @gyzerok)
  * Unify package.json version ranges to be strictly semver-compatible (#241)
  * Fix minor issue in UTF-32 decoder's endianness detection code.


## 0.6.0 / 2020-06-08
  * Updated 'gb18030' encoding to :2005 edition (see https://github.com/whatwg/encoding/issues/22).
  * Removed `iconv.extendNodeEncodings()` mechanism. It was deprecated 5 years ago and didn't work 
    in recent Node versions.
  * Reworked Streaming API behavior in browser environments to fix #204. Streaming API will be 
    excluded by default in browser packs, saving ~100Kb bundle size, unless enabled explicitly using 
    `iconv.enableStreamingAPI(require('stream'))`.
  * Updates to development environment & tests:
    * Added ./test/webpack private package to test complex new use cases that need custom environment. 
      It's tested as a separate job in Travis CI.
    * Updated generation code for the new EUC-KR index file format from Encoding Standard.
    * Removed Buffer() constructor in tests (#197 by @gabrielschulhof).


## 0.5.2 / 2020-06-08
  * Added `iconv.getEncoder()` and `iconv.getDecoder()` methods to typescript definitions (#229).
  * Fixed semver version to 6.1.2 to support Node 8.x (by @tanandara).
  * Capped iconv version to 2.x as 3.x has dropped support for older Node versions.
  * Switched from instanbul to c8 for code coverage.


## 0.5.1 / 2020-01-18

  * Added cp720 encoding (#221, by @kr-deps)
  * (minor) Changed Changelog.md formatting to use h2. 


## 0.5.0 / 2019-06-26

  * Added UTF-32 encoding, both little-endian and big-endian variants (UTF-32LE, UTF32-BE). If endianness
    is not provided for decoding, it's deduced automatically from the stream using a heuristic similar to
    what we use in UTF-16. (great work in #216 by @kshetline)
  * Several minor updates to README (#217 by @oldj, plus some more)
  * Added Node versions 10 and 12 to Travis test harness.

# 0.4.9 / 2015-05-24

   addBOM: true. Added docs to Readme.
 * UTF16 now uses UTF16-LE by default.

 * Added io.js testing on Travis; updated node-iconv version to test against.
   Now we just skip testing SBCS encodings that node-iconv doesn't support.

 * Use strict mode in all files.

   reason: Packages needed for testing are hard to get on Travis CI.
