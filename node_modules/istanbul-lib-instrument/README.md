[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/istanbuljs/istanbul-lib-instrument.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/istanbuljs/istanbul-lib-instrument)

Istanbul instrumenter library.

Version 1.1.x now implements instrumentation using `Babel`. The implementation is inspired
by prior art by @dtinth as demonstrated in the `__coverage__` babel plugin.

It provides 2 "modes" of instrumentation.

<<<<<<< HEAD
-   The old API that is mostly unchanged (except for incompatibilities noted) and
    performs the instrumentation using babel as a library.

-   A `programVisitor` function for the Babel AST that can be used by a Babel plugin
    to emit instrumentation for ES6 code directly without any source map
    processing. This is the preferred path for babel users. The Babel plugin is
    called `babel-plugin-istanbul`.
