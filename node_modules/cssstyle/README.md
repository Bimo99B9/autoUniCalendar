#### Background

This package is an extension of the CSSStyleDeclaration class in Nikita Vasilyev's [CSSOM](https://github.com/NV/CSSOM) with added support for CSS 2 & 3 properties. The primary use case is for testing browser code in a Node environment. 

It was originally created by Chad Walker, it is now maintaind by Jon Sakas and other open source contributors.

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome.

CSSStyleDeclaration is a work-a-like to the CSSStyleDeclaration class in Nikita Vasilyev's [CSSOM](https://github.com/NV/CSSOM). I made it so that when using [jQuery in node](https://github.com/tmtk75/node-jquery) setting css attributes via $.fn.css() would work. node-jquery uses [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) to create a DOM to use in node. jsdom uses CSSOM for styling, and CSSOM's implementation of the [CSSStyleDeclaration](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSSStyleDeclaration) doesn't support [CSS2Properties](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSS2Properties), which is how jQuery's [$.fn.css()](http://api.jquery.com/css/) operates.

### Why not just issue a pull request?

Well, NV wants to keep CSSOM fast (which I can appreciate) and CSS2Properties aren't required by the standard (though every browser has the interface). So I figured the path of least resistance would be to just modify this one class, publish it as a node module (that requires CSSOM) and then make a pull request of jsdom to use it.

### How do I test this code?

`npm test` should do the trick, assuming you have the dev dependencies installed:

```
$ npm test

tests
✔ Verify Has Properties
✔ Verify Has Functions
✔ Verify Has Special Properties
✔ Test From Style String
✔ Test From Properties
✔ Test Shorthand Properties
✔ Test width and height Properties and null and empty strings
✔ Test Implicit Properties
```
