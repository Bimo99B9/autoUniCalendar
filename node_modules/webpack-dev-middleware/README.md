# webpack-dev-middleware

An express-style development middleware for use with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org)
bundles and allows for serving of the files emitted from webpack.
This should be used for **development only**.

Some of the benefits of using this middleware include:

- No files are written to disk, rather it handles files in memory
- If files changed in watch mode, the middleware delays requests until compiling
<<<<<<< HEAD
  has completed.
- Supports hot module reload (HMR).

=======
has completed.
- Supports hot module reload (HMR).

## Requirements

This module requires a minimum of Node v6.9.0 and Webpack v4.0.0, and must be used with a
server that accepts express-style middleware.

>>>>>>> 2cfd330b (move react to root dir)
## Getting Started

First thing's first, install the module:

```console
npm install webpack-dev-middleware --save-dev
```

_Note: We do not recommend installing this module globally._

## Usage

```js
<<<<<<< HEAD
const webpack = require("webpack");
const middleware = require("webpack-dev-middleware");
const compiler = webpack({
  // webpack options
});
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.use(
  middleware(compiler, {
    // webpack-dev-middleware options
  })
);

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Example app listening on port 3000!"));
```

See [below](#other-servers) for an example of use with fastify.

## Options

=======
const webpack = require('webpack');
const middleware = require('webpack-dev-middleware');
const compiler = webpack({ .. webpack options .. });
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

  // webpack-dev-middleware options
}));

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!'))
```

## Options

The middleware accepts an `options` Object. The following is a property reference
for the Object.

_Note: The `publicPath` property is required, whereas all other options are optional_
>>>>>>> 2cfd330b (move react to root dir)

### methods

Type: `Array`  
<<<<<<< HEAD
Default: `[ 'GET', 'HEAD' ]`

This property allows a user to pass the list of HTTP request methods accepted by the middleware\*\*.

### headers

Type: `Array|Object|Function`
Default: `undefined`

This property allows a user to pass custom HTTP headers on each request.
eg. `{ "X-Custom-Header": "yes" }`

or

```js
webpackDevMiddleware(compiler, {
  headers: () => {
    return {
      "Last-Modified": new Date(),
    };
  },
});
```

or

```js
webpackDevMiddleware(compiler, {
  headers: (req, res, context) => {
    res.setHeader("Last-Modified", new Date());
  },
});
```

or

```js
webpackDevMiddleware(compiler, {
  headers: [
    {
      key: "X-custom-header"
      value: "foo"
    },
    {
      key: "Y-custom-header",
      value: "bar"
    }
  ]
  },
});
```

or

```js
webpackDevMiddleware(compiler, {
  headers: () => [
    {
      key: "X-custom-header"
      value: "foo"
    },
    {
      key: "Y-custom-header",
      value: "bar"
    }
  ]
  },
});
```

### index

Type: `Boolean|String`
Default: `index.html`

If `false` (but not `undefined`), the server will not respond to requests to the root URL.

### mimeTypes

Type: `Object`  
Default: `undefined`

This property allows a user to register custom mime types or extension mappings.
eg. `mimeTypes: { phtml: 'text/html' }`.

Please see the documentation for [`mime-types`](https://github.com/jshttp/mime-types) for more information.

### publicPath

Type: `String`
Default: `output.publicPath` (from a configuration)

The public path that the middleware is bound to.

_Best Practice: use the same `publicPath` defined in your webpack config. For more information about `publicPath`, please see [the webpack documentation](https://webpack.js.org/guides/public-path)._

### stats

Type: `Boolean|String|Object`
Default: `stats` (from a configuration)

Stats options object or preset name.
=======
Default: `[ 'GET' ]`

This property allows a user to pass the list of HTTP request methods accepted by the server. 

### headers

Type: `Object`  
Default: `undefined`

This property allows a user to pass custom HTTP headers on each request. eg.
`{ "X-Custom-Header": "yes" }`

### index

Type: `String`  
Default: `undefined`

"index.html",
// The index path for web server, defaults to "index.html".
// If falsy (but not undefined), the server will not respond to requests to the root URL.


### lazy

Type: `Boolean`  
Default: `undefined`

This option instructs the module to operate in 'lazy' mode, meaning that it won't
recompile when files change, but rather on each request.

### logger

Type: `Object`  
Default: [`webpack-log`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-log/blob/master/index.js)

In the rare event that a user would like to provide a custom logging interface,
this property allows the user to assign one. The module leverages
[`webpack-log`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-log#readme)
for creating the [`loglevelnext`](https://github.com/shellscape/loglevelnext#readme)
logging management by default. Any custom logger must adhere to the same
exports for compatibility. Specifically, all custom loggers must have the
following exported methods at a minimum:

- `log.trace`
- `log.debug`
- `log.info`
- `log.warn`
- `log.error`

Please see the documentation for `loglevel` for more information.

### logLevel

Type: `String`  
Default: `'info'`

This property defines the level of messages that the module will log. Valid levels
include:

- `trace`
- `debug`
- `info`
- `warn`
- `error`
- `silent`

Setting a log level means that all other levels below it will be visible in the
console. Setting `logLevel: 'silent'` will hide all console output. The module
leverages [`webpack-log`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-log#readme)
for logging management, and more information can be found on its page.

### logTime

Type: `Boolean`  
Default: `false`

If `true` the log output of the module will be prefixed by a timestamp in the
`HH:mm:ss` format.

### mimeTypes

Type: `Object`  
Default: `null`

This property allows a user to register custom mime types or extension mappings.
eg. `{ 'text/html': [ 'phtml' ] }`. Please see the documentation for
[`node-mime`](https://github.com/broofa/node-mime#mimedefine) for more information.

### publicPath

Type: `String`  
_Required_

The public path that the middleware is bound to. _Best Practice: use the same
`publicPath` defined in your webpack config. For more information about
`publicPath`, please see
[the webpack documentation](https://webpack.js.org/guides/public-path)._

### reporter

Type: `Object`  
Default: `undefined`

Allows users to provide a custom reporter to handle logging within the module.
Please see the [default reporter](/lib/reporter.js)
for an example.
>>>>>>> 2cfd330b (move react to root dir)

### serverSideRender

Type: `Boolean`  
Default: `undefined`

<<<<<<< HEAD
Instructs the module to enable or disable the server-side rendering mode.
Please see [Server-Side Rendering](#server-side-rendering) for more information.
=======
Instructs the module to enable or disable the server-side rendering mode. Please
see [Server-Side Rendering](#server-side-rendering) for more information.

### stats

Type: `Object`  
Default: `{ context: process.cwd() }`

Options for formatting statistics displayed during and after compile. For more
information and property details, please see the
[webpack documentation](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/stats/#stats).

### watchOptions

Type: `Object`  
Default: `{ aggregateTimeout: 200 }`

The module accepts an `Object` containing options for file watching, which is
passed directly to the compiler provided. For more information on watch options
please see the [webpack documentation](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/watch/#watchoptions)
>>>>>>> 2cfd330b (move react to root dir)

### writeToDisk

Type: `Boolean|Function`  
Default: `false`

<<<<<<< HEAD
If `true`, the option will instruct the module to write files to the configured location on disk as specified in your `webpack` config file.
_Setting `writeToDisk: true` won't change the behavior of the `webpack-dev-middleware`, and bundle files accessed through the browser will still be served from memory._
This option provides the same capabilities as the [`WriteFilePlugin`](https://github.com/gajus/write-file-webpack-plugin/pulls).

This option also accepts a `Function` value, which can be used to filter which files are written to disk.
The function follows the same premise as [`Array#filter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) in which a return value of `false` _will not_ write the file, and a return value of `true` _will_ write the file to disk. eg.

```js
const webpack = require("webpack");
const configuration = {
  /* Webpack configuration */
};
const compiler = webpack(configuration);

middleware(compiler, {
  writeToDisk: (filePath) => {
    return /superman\.css$/.test(filePath);
  },
});
```

### outputFileSystem

Type: `Object`  
Default: [memfs](https://github.com/streamich/memfs)

Set the default file system which will be used by webpack as primary destination of generated files.
This option isn't affected by the [writeToDisk](#writeToDisk) option.

You have to provide `.join()` and `mkdirp` method to the `outputFileSystem` instance manually for compatibility with `webpack@4`.

This can be done simply by using `path.join`:

```js
const webpack = require("webpack");
const path = require("path");
const myOutputFileSystem = require("my-fs");
const mkdirp = require("mkdirp");

myOutputFileSystem.join = path.join.bind(path); // no need to bind
myOutputFileSystem.mkdirp = mkdirp.bind(mkdirp); // no need to bind

const compiler = webpack({
  /* Webpack configuration */
});

middleware(compiler, { outputFileSystem: myOutputFileSystem });
=======
If true, the option will instruct the module to write files to the configured
location on disk as specified in your `webpack` config file. _Setting
`writeToDisk: true` won't change the behavior of the `webpack-dev-middleware`,
and bundle files accessed through the browser will still be served from memory._
This option provides the same capabilities as the
[`WriteFilePlugin`](https://github.com/gajus/write-file-webpack-plugin/pulls).

This option also accepts a `Function` value, which can be used to filter which
files are written to disk. The function follows the same premise as
[`Array#filter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)
in which a return value of `false` _will not_ write the file, and a return value
of `true` _will_ write the file to disk. eg.

```js
{
  writeToDisk: (filePath) {
    return /superman\.css$/.test(filePath);
  }
}
>>>>>>> 2cfd330b (move react to root dir)

## API

`webpack-dev-middleware` also provides convenience methods that can be use to
interact with the middleware at runtime:

### `close(callback)`

<<<<<<< HEAD
Instructs `webpack-dev-middleware` instance to stop watching for file changes.

#### Parameters

##### `callback`

Type: `Function`
Required: `No`

A function executed once the middleware has stopped watching.

```js
const express = require("express");

const compiler = webpack({
  /* Webpack configuration */
});
const middleware = require("webpack-dev-middleware");
const instance = middleware(compiler);

const app = new express();
=======
Instructs a webpack-dev-middleware instance to stop watching for file changes.

### Parameters

#### callback

Type: `Function`

A function executed once the middleware has stopped watching.

### `invalidate()`

Instructs a webpack-dev-middleware instance to recompile the bundle.
e.g. after a change to the configuration.

```js
const webpack = require('webpack');
const compiler = webpack({ ... });
const middleware = require('webpack-dev-middleware');
const instance = middleware(compiler);
>>>>>>> 2cfd330b (move react to root dir)

app.use(instance);

setTimeout(() => {
<<<<<<< HEAD
  // Says `webpack` to stop watch changes
  instance.close();
}, 1000);
```

### `invalidate(callback)`

Instructs `webpack-dev-middleware` instance to recompile the bundle, e.g. after a change to the configuration.

#### Parameters

##### `callback`

const instance = middleware(compiler);

const app = new express();

app.use(instance);

setTimeout(() => {
  // After a short delay the configuration is changed and a banner plugin is added to the config
  new webpack.BannerPlugin("A new banner").apply(compiler);
=======
  // After a short delay the configuration is changed and a banner plugin is added
  // to the config
  compiler.apply(new webpack.BannerPlugin('A new banner'));
>>>>>>> 2cfd330b (move react to root dir)

  // Recompile the bundle with the banner plugin:
  instance.invalidate();
}, 1000);
```

### `waitUntilValid(callback)`

Executes a callback function when the compiler bundle is valid, typically after
compilation.

<<<<<<< HEAD
#### Parameters

##### `callback`

Type: `Function`
Required: `No`

A function executed when the bundle becomes valid.
If the bundle is valid at the time of calling, the callback is executed immediately.

```js
const express = require("express");
const webpack = require("webpack");

## Known Issues

### Multiple Successive Builds

<<<<<<< HEAD
Watching will frequently cause multiple compilations
=======
Watching (by means of `lazy: false`) will frequently cause multiple compilations
>>>>>>> 2cfd330b (move react to root dir)
as the bundle changes during compilation. This is due in part to cross-platform
differences in file watchers, so that webpack doesn't loose file changes when
watched files change rapidly. If you run into this situation, please make use of
the [`TimeFixPlugin`](https://github.com/egoist/time-fix-plugin).

## Server-Side Rendering

_Note: this feature is experimental and may be removed or changed completely in the future._

In order to develop an app using server-side rendering, we need access to the
[`stats`](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/node.js-api#stats), which is
generated with each build.

<<<<<<< HEAD
With server-side rendering enabled, `webpack-dev-middleware` sets the `stats` to `res.locals.webpack.devMiddleware.context.stats`
and the filesystem to `res.locals.webpack.devMiddleware.context.outputFileSystem` before invoking the next middleware,
allowing a developer to render the page body and manage the response to clients.
=======
With server-side rendering enabled, `webpack-dev-middleware` sets the `stat` to
`res.locals.webpackStats` and the memory filesystem to `res.locals.fs` before invoking the next middleware, allowing a
developer to render the page body and manage the response to clients.
>>>>>>> 2cfd330b (move react to root dir)

_Note: Requests for bundle files will still be handled by
`webpack-dev-middleware` and all requests will be pending until the build
process is finished with server-side rendering enabled._

Example Implementation:

```js
<<<<<<< HEAD
const express = require("express");
const webpack = require("webpack");
const compiler = webpack({
  /* Webpack configuration */
});
const isObject = require("is-object");
const middleware = require("webpack-dev-middleware");

const app = new express();
=======
const webpack = require('webpack');
const compiler = webpack({ ... });
const isObject = require('is-object');
const middleware = require('webpack-dev-middleware');
>>>>>>> 2cfd330b (move react to root dir)

// This function makes server rendering of asset references consistent with different webpack chunk/entry configurations
function normalizeAssets(assets) {
  if (isObject(assets)) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    return Object.values(assets);
  }

  return Array.isArray(assets) ? assets : [assets];
}

app.use(middleware(compiler, { serverSideRender: true }));

// The following middleware would not be invoked until the latest build is finished.
app.use((req, res) => {
  const { devMiddleware } = res.locals.webpack;
  const outputFileSystem = devMiddleware.context.outputFileSystem;
  const jsonWebpackStats = devMiddleware.context.stats.toJson();
  const { assetsByChunkName, outputPath } = jsonWebpackStats;

  // Then use `assetsByChunkName` for server-side rendering
=======
    return Object.values(assets)
  }
  return Array.isArray(assets) ? assets : [assets]
}

app.use(middleware(compiler, { serverSideRender: true }))

// The following middleware would not be invoked until the latest build is finished.
app.use((req, res) => {
  const assetsByChunkName = res.locals.webpackStats.toJson().assetsByChunkName
  const fs = res.locals.fs
  const outputPath = res.locals.webpackStats.toJson().outputPath

  // then use `assetsByChunkName` for server-sider rendering
>>>>>>> 2cfd330b (move react to root dir)
  // For example, if you have only one main chunk:
  res.send(`
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My App</title>
    <style>
<<<<<<< HEAD
    ${normalizeAssets(assetsByChunkName.main)
      .filter((path) => path.endsWith(".css"))
      .map((path) => outputFileSystem.readFileSync(path.join(outputPath, path)))
      .join("\n")}
=======
		${normalizeAssets(assetsByChunkName.main)

## Support

We do our best to keep Issues in the repository focused on bugs, features, and
needed modifications to the code for the module. Because of that, we ask users
with general support, "how-to", or "why isn't this working" questions to try one
of the other support channels that are available.

Your first-stop-shop for support for webpack-dev-server should by the excellent
[documentation][docs-url] for the module. If you see an opportunity for improvement
of those docs, please head over to the [webpack.js.org repo][wjo-url] and open a
pull request.

From there, we encourage users to visit the [webpack Gitter chat][chat-url] and
talk to the fine folks there. If your quest for answers comes up dry in chat,
head over to [StackOverflow][stack-url] and do a quick search or open a new
question. Remember; It's always much easier to answer questions that include your
`webpack.config.js` and relevant files!

If you're twitter-savvy you can tweet [#webpack][hash-url] with your question
and someone should be able to reach out and lend a hand.

## Other servers

Examples of use with other servers will follow here.

### Fastify

Fastify interop will require the use of `fastify-express` instead of `middie` for providing middleware support. As the authors of `fastify-express` recommend, this should only be used as a stopgap while full Fastify support is worked on.

```js
const fastify = require("fastify")();
const webpack = require("webpack");
const webpackConfig = require("./webpack.config.js");
const devMiddleware = require("webpack-dev-middleware");

const compiler = webpack(webpackConfig);
const { publicPath } = webpackConfig.output;

(async () => {
  await fastify.register(require("fastify-express"));
  await fastify.use(devMiddleware(compiler, { publicPath }));
  await fastify.listen(3000);
})();
```
